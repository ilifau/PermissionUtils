Supported versions: ILIAS 5.1 (branch ilias51),  ILIAS 5.2 (branch master)

## Objective

New ILIAS versions or ILIAS plugins may introduce new object types that need a setting of their default permissions in existing roles and role templates. Additionally the existing container objects need an initialization of the create permissions for the new types. Setting these manually can be expensive or even impossible, if an installation uses many local roles.

The solution of this add-on tries to automate this by copying the permissions of the new object types from existing similar object types. An InteractiveVideo plugin, for example may be seen as similar to a MediaCast. Therefore everyone who has the create permission for a MediaCast in a course should be able to create an InteractiveVideo in this course. And everyone who has default write permission on MediaCasts in a course should have write permission in new InteractiveVideo objects created in this course.

## Installation and Usage

* Clone the PermissionUtils directly under the Customizing directory of your ILIAS installation.
* Extend *patches/class.ilPermissionPatches.php* by creating your own function. You may copy initInteractiveVideo() as an Example.
* Add a patch call of your function in apply.php and uncomment it.
* Run apply.php from the command line: 
```
php apply.php username password client_id
```

## Writing Patches

The following functions of ilPermissionUtils will help you to write your own permission initializations:

The following functions are available:
* **copyDefaultPermission()** copies a single default permission in all roles and role templates, including local policies. Source type and operation may be different from target type and operation but normally the operation is the same. This is typically used to initialize read and write permissions.
* **copyDefaultPermissions()** copies default permissions for a couple of object types. Here the source type and target type are the same, but the operations can differ. This is typically used to initialize the default create permissions.
* **copyPermissions()** copies actual permissions in objects of given types. The signature is the same as for copyDefaultPermissions(). This is typically used to initialize the actual create permissions.

## Getting Object and Permission Lists

Some SQL queries will help you to find out which object and permission types exist in your ILIAS installation.

This query selects all objects types that are under RBAC control:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(ob.title), ob.description, ob.create_date
FROM object_data ob
INNER JOIN rbac_ta ta ON ob.obj_id = ta.typ_id
```

This query selects all operations:
```sql
SELECT operation, description, class
FROM rbac_operations
ORDER BY class, ops_id
```

This query gives you a complete list of all defined permission:
```sql
SELECT ob.title, ob.description, op.operation, op.description
FROM object_data ob
INNER JOIN rbac_ta ta ON ob.obj_id = ta.typ_id
INNER JOIN rbac_operations op ON ta.ops_id = op.ops_id
ORDER BY ob.title, op.class, op.op_order
```

This query gives you the defined permissions that are new in ILIAS 5.2 compared to ILIAS 5.1. You must have databases of both versions on your server. Please change the database names to those of yours:
```sql
SELECT ob.title, ob.description, op.operation, op.description
FROM ilias52.object_data ob
INNER JOIN ilias52.rbac_ta ta ON ob.obj_id = ta.typ_id
INNER JOIN ilias52.rbac_operations op ON ta.ops_id = op.ops_id
WHERE NOT EXISTS
(	SELECT * FROM ilias51.rbac_ta
	WHERE typ_id = ob.obj_id AND ops_id = op.ops_id
)
ORDER BY ob.title, op.class, op.op_order
```
